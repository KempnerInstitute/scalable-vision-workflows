Please refer the Please refer to the [ResNet benchmarking section](https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/scalable-vision-workflows/tree/main/imagenet1k_resnet50)
for detailed information on software setup and data preparation.  Here we outline the main difference in 
executing the AlexNet model and the execution time. 

Please refer to the ResNet benchmarking section for detailed information on software setup and data preparation.

This section highlights the key differences involved in running the AlexNet model, as well as its execution time, compared to ResNet.

To run AlexNet using the provided Slurm job script, set the following environment variable:

```bash

ARCHITECTURE=alexnet

```

In the provided Slurm job script, set the variable ARCHITECTURE=alexnet.
