# Benchmarking Run Results

A paragraph about the results.

## Environmental Variables

In order to keep the runs portable and seemless run experiance for different users, you need to set up a couple of environmental variables. To be able to run these benchmarks. 

- `PROJECT_DIR_PATH`: This is the path to the project directory. If you are using the project from the git repository, this should be the path to the root of the project.
- `CONDA_ENV_PATH`:
- `IMAGENET_DATA_PATH`: This is the path to the imagenet data directory. This should be the path to the directory where the imagenet data is stored.
